## Programming and AI/ML Projects

### Image Classification using TensorFlow (rockpaperscisors)
The project uses rock, paper, scissors labels defined in the labels.txt file to classiy the captured picture for image classification using Keras API
File Keras_modek.h5 contains the ML model definition and parameters

Example output:

1/1 [==============================] - 2s 2s/step
0 Rock
 vs 
1 Paper

Computer wins!
Class: Rock
Confidence Score: 0.99723583

### Sentiment Analysis
Project creates a ML model using Tensorflow Keras API for sentiment analysis of the customer reviews of a product and categories it as positive, negative or neutral reviews. The program includes using he input dataset, cleaning the dataset for training and inference. The model run also charts the output for the test data run for human readable output of the result.

### Text Generation
Project uses Tensorlow Keras API to build a ML model for generating a cooking recepie given brief description of the item to be cooked. The training dataset consists of a variety of cooking recepie and the objective of ML model is to complete a partial recepie using text generation. ML model is a recurrent neural network used to analyze textual or visual data that is sequential

### Conversational Chatbot
A recurrent neural network model using TensorFlow and NumPy to generate responses to user-inputted questions. Implemented optimization techniques such as gradient descent, loss function normalization, and transfer learning to enhance model performance. Program uses training data sets for casual conversation. Repository contains additional datasets based on topic or areas of interest such as "Ordinary Life", "School Life", "Finance". Additionally, the data sets also contain emotional sentiment analysis data. Note that the ML model has been trained only on ordinary Life conversations but can be extended for other data sets as well

### Minesweeper game design using Python
Minesweeper game utilizing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and recursion.
